## Deginner Projects

### MREST Explorer

[src](https://bitbucket.org/deginner/mrest-explorer)

A [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)-based Javascript application for exploring MREST servers. Perfect for use as an admin site for your application.

### Deglet

[src](https://bitbucket.org/deginner/deglet) [demo](http://deglet.xyz)

A [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)-based Bitcoin wallet. Uses the [bitcore](http://bitcore.io/) services developed by [bitpay](http://bitpay.com/) for the wallet. Uses [Coinapult](https://coinapult.com) for conversions.

## Private (for now?)

### Cosigner

[src](https://bitbucket.org/deginner/cosigner-server)

This server provides a uniform interface for managing cosigning wallets, transactions and cosign requests.

### Shared Wallet

[src](https://bitbucket.org/deginner/shared-wallet)

A shared wallet server, for maintaining a centralized ledger of accounts. Accounts can transfer amounts to each other, deposit and withdraw.

### Exchange Node

[src](https://bitbucket.org/deginner/exchange-node)

Each Exchange Node operates a single orderbook, representing a currency pair (i.e. BTC/USD).

### Exchange Broker

[src](https://bitbucket.org/deginner/exchange-broker)

An automated exchange broker, which will create and fill guaranteed quotes for clients.

A quote consists of Exchange Node orders which the client needs to approve. Once the client approves the orders, and the shared wallet indicate the quote is funded, the broker will fill the orders, fulfilling its quoted obligation to the user.
